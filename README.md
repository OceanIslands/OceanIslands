# OceanIslands
Fork of the plugin [IridiumSkyblock](https://github.com/IridiumLLC/IridiumSkyblock/) which generates ocean islands instead of weird islands flying in the sky.<br>
Please be aware: The plugin should work in all versions that IridiumSkyblock supports, but the default island schematics were made in the 1.16.

## Download
Check the [Releases page](https://github.com/OceanIslands/OceanIslands/releases)

## New config options (config.json)
### minOceanFloorLevel
The minimal y-level of the ocean floor.<br>
Default value: 15
### maxOceanFloorLevel
The maximal y-level of the ocean floor.<br>
Default value: 25
### waterHeight
The height of the water. You have to adjust the schematic position manually when changing this!<br>
Default value: 80
### netherLavaOcean
Whether the nether island should be surrounded by lava or not. Setting it to false will generate water like in the overworld.<br>
Default value: true

## Todo
- Improve the world generator
- Add better schematics (I'm just a terrible builder)
